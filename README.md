In this project, we used factor analysis to identify the underlying factors that influence passenger satisfaction in the airline industry. We employed two distinct approaches: Explanatory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) and compared the results to gain a deeper understanding of the key factors related to satisfaction. Our study provided a comprehensive understanding of the factors that drive airline passenger satisfaction and can inform targeted service improvements. ðŸ˜Š
